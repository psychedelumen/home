But how might we conceptualize the opening symphony of self-transforming form constants—radiating, bursting, breathing, rotating, drifting and pearlescing fretworks, filigrees, lattices, ribbons, spirals, bows, specs, funnels, wheels, waves, tunnels, tapestries, and arabesques? Some may recall  Bressloff and colleagues (2001) whom demonstrated in “Geometric visual hallucinations, Euclidean symmetry and the functional architecture of the striate cortex” that these patterns could be matched to interacting neural structures within the visual cortex (it is worth adding that these occipital structures were tuned, incidentally, by repeated visual experience with the help of the serotonin system throughout early development, ). While the finer details of Bressloff and colleague’s findings are beyond the scope of this work, they  make a keen note that these patterns are “seen as a result of an interaction between mechanisms subserving the retrieval of visual memories and those involving focal attention.” 

If we interpret this alongside the psychedelic-induced increased parahippocampal information flow to the visual cortex, perhaps the form constants seen in high-dose psychedelic experience reflect the early stages of a process in which focal attention broadens, and begins to draw on the semantic and episodic foundations of being, effectively imbuing sensory experience with increasingly eclectic significance. With increasing dose and time, alongside increasing cortical midline self-related processing, this exteroception gradually turns to interoception, and experience of the outer world gives way to a multifaceted array of increasingly vivid, and in some cases, increasingly dramatic emotional scenarios and personally meaningful visionary experiences–experiences with the potential to guide our attention and behaviour, given the appropriate conditions, perhaps not unlike the stars guided early life out of their primordial puddles, plants out of the shadows, and early astronomers to the mathematical precursors of modern science and technology.

Belser points out that such sensuous features as meaningful visionary phenomena, reminiscent of the cognitive technology of the deepest stages of dreaming, are part of what philosophers of religion consider to be *theistic* aspects of mystical experience. As a result, some (e.g. monistic mystics) have considered them to be irrelevant peripheral features in favor of experience of unity and self-transcendence, leaving them entirely left out of the canonical Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). But Belser et al, 2017 find, based on phenomenological analysis of participant experiences, that these sensory phenomena are often meaningful, appear among the most frequently reported features by participants, and represent substantial and significant parts of psychedelic experience that should not be ignored. 

As we saw in the previous section, the roles of serotonin, just like those of auxin, go beyond simply orienting organisms with patterns of light, and extend into almost all aspects of life, perhaps—if we accept Azmitia’s characterization—ultimately integrating mind, body and world.

##### Unity and associated phenomena
It is no secret that classical psychedelics frequently initiate subjective experiences in which the boundaries between mind, body and world begin to dissolve and, in some cases, disappear. Ego dissolution, unity, loss of sense of self, self-transcendence, and oneness—the breakdown of the perceived difference between the mind, body (i.e. the self) and world. Such psychedelic-induced experiences of extraordinary absorption are similar (and some propose identical) to advanced states of mystical contemplative practices, and have long been a matter of serious focus for many academic researchers. 

But the experience of unity *by itself,* according to Rieser and colleagues, “has not been shown to be related to therapeutic effects.” Rather, therapeutic benefits appear to relate more strongly to broader mystical experience, in particular a combination of experiences that involve not only unity but also insight as well as bliss. In fact, Alan K Davis et al recently developed a questionnaire called the Psychedelic Insight Questionnaire (PIQ) and has discovered that experiencing insights involving awareness about relationships, past events, goals, and values may be an even stronger predictor of wellbeing than overall mystical experience.

Vollenweider emphasizes accordingly that while ego dissolution can be separated from other psychedelic phenomena conceptually, the various psychometrically measured dimensions of psychedelic experience appear to be “theoretically, experientially and mathematically” interrelated:

>“The phenomenon of ego-dissolution is neither an all or nothing affair nor does it occur on its own [...] ego dissolution arises dose-dependently along a perception-hallucination continuum associated with increased sensory and emotional arousal, distinct changes in cognitive functions, the release of emotions, often with the recall of emotionally loaded autobiographic memories, and increased capacity for introspection.”

According to Vollenweider et al, Hanscarl Leuner, the originator of Psycholytic Therapy and Guided Affective Imagery, proposed in 1962, 1981, that ego dissolution was driven by four key processes, including increases in internal sensory stimulus production, activation of basic emotions and autobiographical memories, regression of ego-functions, and auto-production of symbolic imagery (and meaning). Building on Leuner’s hypothesis along with the pioneering work by Masters & Houston and James H Austin (an american neurologist known for his research investigating meditative practices and the brain), Preller & Vollenweider (20XX) depict “the dropout of the phenomenological ego” as a dynamic process that progresses along a continuum of increasing arousal (i.e. excitation) and ego dissolution, and unfolds in several stages accompanied by alterations at the perceptual level, recollective-psychodynamic level, symbolic existential level, and deep integral level of self-transcendence. 

As Masters and Houston describe, while the experience unfolds along this excitation-dissolution continuum, subjects may examine personal and relationship problems and life goals; analyze unconscious material, experience eidedic memories and images that illustrate them; recognize problems along with what should be done about them; grasp multiple meanings and shades of meaning; experience insights that enable them to revise their thinking, self-image, and behavior in desirable ways; find opportunities for growth and maturation, and engage with dramatic myths and legends or passing through initiations or rituals “often seemingly structured precisely in terms of his own most urgent needs.” When they engage with these types of dramas, they may come to solutions, “by imagination, ideation, sensations, and affective or kinsesthetic involvement,” Vollenweider and Preller explain, “that can result in a quiet but powerful emotional response and tension release that appears to be transformative and beneficial to the person” [s]. This process echoes the earlier discussed findings that therapeutic benefits may relate to experiences invovling not only unity but instead a combination that additionally includes insight as well as bliss.

Ultimately, Masters and Houston find, if the subject can be encouraged to explore the contents of each level in a way that is sufficiently rich and varied, the cumulative insights and associations can lead to a deeper understanding of the “complex network” of their being, and “ideation, images, body sensation (if any) and emotion” may fuse in a purposive process that in some cases culminates in a sense of “self-understanding, selftransformation, religious enlightenment and, possibly, mystical union,”  (Masters & Houston).

Altogether, it is clear that “experience of unity” and “insightfulness” dance closely together. Psychometric studies in controlled settings also support this notion, finding that insightfulness stands among the most highly correlated factors with experience of unity. 

But the exact neural bases of the psychedelic-induced experience of insight and unity remain an area of active investigation, in a field, as described by Belser, currently marked by theory building and hypothesis testing. 

##### The intgrative mechanism of Ego-dissolution
As pointed out by Vollenweider (20XX), the neural substrates of ego dissolution is a contentious issue, as it has been correlated with a number of disparate findings.* While an exhaustive account of these possible neuroscientific bases of ego dissolution lays beyond the scope of this work, we will focus here on a particularly intriguing line of research involving the cortical midline structures we discussed earlier (which are, again, considered essential for ascribing personal meaning to information)

Vollenweider (2XXX) found that under the effects of psychedelics, the P300—an electrophysiological signal in one of the structures belonging to the cortical midline called the anterior cingulate cortex, which helps distinguish stimuli which carry personal significance from stimuli that do not—becomes blurred. This was associated with experience of unity. But it was also associated with changed meaning of percepts (i.e. the proneness to find personal meaning in experience/the environment).* 

> [!NOTE] \*
> Vollenweider et al thus posits, alongside work by de Greck et al. (2008) and Northoff & Hayes (2011), that meaning attribution is deeply intertwined with self-processes, which include self-relatedness, reward effects, and valuation systems, [altogether emphasizing that personal significance of stimuli is closely tied to its perceived value, implications, and meaningfulness.]

This blurring of the self-other signal in the anterior cingulate along with the intensified personal relevance processing in other cortical midline structures during psychedelic experience, together sugest that the sense of self, rather than being simply diminished, paradoxically expands to include more of the world.

This observation aligns well with findings of participants retrospectively reporting a sense of interconnectedness, in which they felt more connected to “everyone and everything,” more “woven” into a “greater whole,” and feeling like “part of the world instead of separate from it.” (Belser 2017). Such experiences introduce the intriguing possibility that psychedelic experience could help cultivate a concern for the world as if it were an integral part of ourselves, and further, perhaps even help cultivate foundational systems thinking skills, such as identifying dynamic systems, by brining awareness to the interconnections that help constitute systems in the world.

##### From interconnection to insight, Self-transformation and Self-direction
While it is difficult to say whether or not this meaningful unity and interconnection definitely contributes to psychedelic insight, some research finds that the neural foundations of psychedelic manifestations of insightfulness may differ from those for unity, suggesting that while the two may be systematically related, they likely represent distinct phenomena. In their research, Vollenweider et al. found that reported intensity of insightfulness experienced by psychedelic participants increased in association with synchronization of delta oscillations between areas of the parahippocampal gyrus, the retrosplenial cortex, and the orbitofrontal cortex—structures involved in coding the location of the self in space, in autobiographical memory retrieval, and in the attribution of emotional valence (i.e. pleasantness and unpleasantness) in memory. Given the association of insightfulness with the synchronization of these particular nodes, they posit that psychedelic-induced insightfulness may be related to a process involved in the retrieval and/or reattribution (/re-evaluation) of autobiographical memories, and further, that “with increasing intensity of spiritual experiences, the self is reorganized within the global spatial context.” 

Let’s elaborate. 

The functions of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), much like those of serotonin and auxin, appear to be involved in many of facets of life. It has, over the years, been implicated in recognizing emotions and experiencing emotional empathy, semantic aspects of symbol and language, insight, inhibiting inappropriate actions, and making decisions that align with our values and goals.  But, as with serotonin, its involvement in such a wide variety of processes has hindered the development of a concise understanding of its functions.

In *The Orbitofrontal Oracle: Cortical Mechanisms for the Prediction and Evaluation of Specific Behavioral Outcomes,* Rudebeck and Murary devise a view of the orbitofrontal cortex akin to the brain’s Antikythera mechanism--a masterfully crafted intricate mechanical device of classical antiquity found in the wreck of a Roman galleon, whose function remained a mystery for generations after its discovery. With great deliberation, researchers eventually deduced that the Antikythera mechanism could calculate, based on given inputs, the future locations of the Sun, the moon, the stars, and planets of our solar system, and was thus capable of producing accurate predictions of future eclipses and other significant celestial events. 

Much like the Antikythera mechanism, the orbitofrontal part of the prefrontal cortex, Rudebeck and Murray explain, is capable of calculating and representing the likely outcomes of possible courses of action. By integrating an extensive range of neural connections from the mind, body and world—including somato- and viscero-sensory areas, as well as areas related to emotion, memory, motivation, and motor control—the orbitofrontal cortex can sense our current internal state along with the biological value (e.g. rewarding or aversive) of rules, objects and courses of action in the environment. It then communicates these features to other parts of the brain to dynamically orient our attention and behavior to navigate the world accordingly.

In doing so, the OFC not only forecasts the possibilities that await us but imbues us with the power to act congruently with self-determined objectives, contributing intention and purpose to our decisions and enabling us to navigate our live with self-direction.

The next node of this network of regions is the retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The retrosplenial cortex is perhaps best known for its involvement in both autobiographical recall and imagination of future events. One theory highlights its key role in scene construction—generating and manipulating a complex or coherent scene—and “may process more schematic, or prototypical, representations of context, previously termed ‘context frames.’”

At last, the entorhinal cortex (ETR) of the parahippocampal gyrus is known as the major input-output device of the hippocampal formation. It plays an important role in forming and retrieving memories, in particular coding spatial relations between the self and the world, and contains cells that code head direction, border detection, relative location, landmark distance, and travel speed.

###### Implications 
Given this quick overview of the orbitofrontal, retrosplenial, and entorhinal cortical regions, psychdelic insight and related self-transformation probably involve several interacting cognitive processes that include recollecting parts of past experience, imagining features of future events, constructing and manipulating complex scenes, generating schematic/prototypical representations of context, coding our coordinates in the world, and interleaving our current state, our memories, rules of the environment, along with our values, with the potential to sample the possibilities of different courses of action and navigate the world with self-direction. 

So if we were to build on Vollenweider’s et al’s hypothsis, psychedelic experiences of insight may involve a reorganization of the self not only in a global spatial but also temporal context—that that of our past, present and future potential. 

These views align neatly with the types of insights (e.g. involving past events, goals, and values) found by Davis et al to predict changes in life satisfaction, wellbeing, and psychological flexibility. They additionally fall nicely in line with the earlier mentioned observations of Belser et al 2017, who found that psychedelic experiences can become “central organizing motifs through which participants could draw disparate elements of their lived experiences into coherent self-narratives,” and finally align with research finding that participants with major depression may have more realistic positive forecasting of future life events following psilocybin treatment [s]

This insightful reorganization of self in a global spatial and temporal context is also relevant to Belser et al (2017), whom conducted an interpretive phenomenological analysis on participant experiences. In their work, they identified several common themes; among the most frequent were ‘wisdom lessons,’ revised life priorities,’ ‘lasting changes to sense of identity,’ and ‘from separateness to interconnectedness.’ The participants also reported things such as being better able to find what was most important to them, shifting their priorities and reorienting their lives accordingly, and finding lasting benefits to their lifestyle and quality of life. “Similar to providing a shift toward what is most meaningful in life,” they wrote, participants reported improved ability to respond to stressors and overcome barriers and being better able to do things they have wanted to do. Some reported that they came to feel more in touch with their “real self,” feeling “reborn in a way.” 

Additionally, as described by Doblin, “the experimental subjects wrote that the experience helped them to resolve career decisions,”  [s]. And, according to Masters and Houston, for subjects who did experience transformative changes, the changes tended to be even “more profound and fundamental” than the peak experiences described by Abram Maslow, which he considered to be generally reserved for fully actualized individuals.

This is particularly relevant to the question of whether psychedelics are capable of catalyzing authentic mystical experience, as one of the basic criteria by which mystical experiences have been deemed authentic is whether they result in lasting transformation (James 1958, 368). 

However, it is said that the goal of classical mysticism extends beyond the bounds of the individual, and involves more than just any kind of transformation. The purpose of mysticism is to align oneself with reality in the process of that transformation (as defined by one’s tradition; e.g., attaining the selflessness of nirvana or aligning one’s will with God’s.) [[Mysticism (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)\|(S)]]. For Richard King, the “privatization of mysticism” is to reduce mysticism to “a personal matter of cultivating inner states of tranquility and equanimity, which, rather than seeking to transform the world, serve to accommodate the individual to the status quo through the alleviation of anxiety and stress.”

##### Beyond the therapeutic paradigm
True “mystical illumination is interpreted as a central visionary experience in a psychological and behavioural process” resulting in the resolution of problems, depicting mysticism as “an extreme and intense form of the insight seeking process that goes in activities such as solving theoretical problems or developing new inventions.” 

If psychedelic experience is capable, as Letheby put it, of catalyzing “a transformative re-appraisal of fundamental assumptions about the self, the world, and the relations between the two,” and to manifest insightful experiences involving relationships, past experience, values and goals, it is critical that we avoid reducing our conceptualization of psychedelic experience to the purpose of relieving psychiatric illness. To see classical psychedelics purely as medicines would be to forget a universe of significant celestial phenomena while observing a single star. Just as ego dissolution is deeply intertwined with other psychedelic phenomena, mental health and wellbeing are inextricably linked to the broader context of our lives, including the value we bring to the world. 

Since publishing the original version of this work in 2020, brilliant practical example relevant to this discussion has emerged of how analogies between plants and human ecosystems can be used to convey and facilitate psychedelic interventions. Dr. Rosalind Watts, a British psychotherapist and researcher from Imperial College London, has developed a form of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) which embeds the widely used ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody) framework in a matrix of plant-based metaphors. In the process of developing this approach, Watts identified a missing component in the ACE framework which she considers essential for sustained therapeutic outcomes. The “Restore” component she adds, forming “ACER,” after the Acer tree) consists of bringing value back to the ecosystems of which we are part, though our projects, our services, and the ideas we bring to the world, and so forth. 

While Dr. Watts offers a few thematic examples to fulfill this restoration component (such as tree-based visualizations, meditations, seasonal calendars, recurring tree-themed lessons, tree planting gatherings and online meetups with co-participants), it can be implemented on step earlier, by explicitly preparing psychedelic experience with the purpose of synthesizing and creating value for the ecosystems that support us. 

Besides emotional breakthroughs, what kinds of technological, scientific, engineering, creative or procedural breakthroughs might we develop if the set and setting for psychedelic experience could be tuned to promote these kinds of explorations—in the same way as the therapeutic framework promotes the relief of psychological suffering? 

What kinds of turning points could be created if the cognitive machinery of psychedelic experience—with its power to induce eidedic recollection, scene construction, and analogy, to see the world as personally significant, to produce insights relating to past experience, values and goals—were explicitly applied to the creative potentials of professional pursuits?

What if these cognitive alterations, alongside newfound sense of interconnectedness between self and world, could help prime the mind for the development of foundational systems thinking skills, such as identifying dynamic systems and behaviors, recognizing interconnections and non-linear relationships, exploring multiple perspectives, considering the wholes and parts, and the cyclical process of gaining and using insight (Arnold & Wade, 2017; Tang, 2020))?

What kind of pernicious, pervasive, or prescient problems could be solved if the visionary potential of psychedelic experience were applied not only to the individual and interpersonal but beyond, into every domain of life?

As Masters and Houston once stated, 


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><div class="markdown-embed">



### "Under no circumstances must it be monopolized by psychiatrists." 
>"When it finally happens that psychedelic research—left sufficiently free to realize the potentials—is permitted, then that freedom must include an agreement that under no circumstances must it be monopolized by psychiatrists. Psychologists, philosophers, theologians, anthropologists, artists, scientists, engineers—those from the many different disciplines and fields—must be allowed to contribute to the body of knowledge that will be generated. Given the range and diversity of the psychedelic experience—and truly nothing human is alien to it—investigation must be multidisciplinary if it is not to be warped and stunted. And we must understand and agree that some of this work will be exploration, not subject to the kinds of constraints imposed if it were to be more narrowly defined."
>- Robert Masters, The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience (2000 ed., p.vii)

But it is equally important that *psychedelic experience* itself be supported and encouraged to contribute to the bodies of knowledge of these very same different disciplines and fields. 

##### Neuroplasticity and related outcomes
Supporting the lasting effects of (and possibly facilitating) these experience are psychedelic-induced neuroplastic changes. Just as auxin has been implicated in directing the growth of plant organs to tract sources of energy in acts of photo and other tropisms, serotonergic psychedelics appear to engage mechanisms involved in neurotropism, neurotrophism, and neuroplasticity [s] “within brain structures critical for the integration of information relevant to sensation, cognition, emotions, and the narrative of self.” [s]

In contrast to the hyperplastic changes known to be related to substance addictions, a hallmark of classical psychedelics is their power to engage mechanisms of plasticity that can persist for several weeks after the experience wears off [s].*

> [!NOTE] \*
> an extended period possibly proportional to the duration of the substance’s acute subjective effects (Nardou et al 2023).

Several candidate mechanisms for this effect have been discovered. Psychedelics have been found to increase plasma BDNF [s], promote longlasting structural plasticity changes involving synapto-, neurito- spino- and dentrito-genesis via the mTOR pathway [s], and trigger an mTOR-BDNF signaling loop; they have been found to modulate neuroplasticity-related genes (Magaraggia et al 2023), including those involved in “nervous system development, axon guidance, synaptic plasticity, quantity and cell viability of neurons and protein translation” (Inserra et al 2022); they may also indirectly promote plasticity by quieting an overactive immune system (acting as powerful anti-inflammatories and anti-oxidants), as well as an overactive hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (which is often dysregulated in stress-related and depressive disorders). Some researchers even found that psychedelics increased numbers of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [s], suggesting that psychedelics may help restore and maintain brain myelin (white matter) . 

Most strikingly, Nardou et al 2023 find that psychelics appear to induce *metaplasticity*—the “dynamic regualation of the extent to which synaptic plasticity can be induced”—also known as “one of the mechanisms underlying the establishment of critical periods.” During neurodevelopmental critical periods*, our brain circuits become, as Lepow et al (2021) put it, “exquisitely sensitive” to the environment; the brain’s malleability renders it more vulnerable to environmental insults and deprivations and but it comes substantially better at learning and acquiring skills, so the overall effects of experiences on lifelong psychological functioning are more profound and long-lasting.

> [!NOTE] \*
>  e.g. imprinting, language learning, and brain circuit rearrangement following sensory or motor perturbations, like ocular dominance plasticity and motor learning after a stroke
>

Psychedelic-induced neuroplastic changes have been associated with a variety of outcomes, including increased resting-state functional connections across the brain, improved response of prefrontal (dlPFC and mOFC) regions along with reduced amygdala reactivity to emotionally conflicting stimuli [s]; protection against stress-induced anxiety, damage to neuronal dendrites and to brainstem serotonin activity [s], accelerated learning, memory and fear extinction; improved pattern separation associated with reduced negativity bias [s]; and improved cognitive flexibility [s].


##### Re-integration and conclusion
*“... truly nothing human is alien to it”*
- Masters & Houson

Modern clinical investigations are finding that, in the appropriate context, and when properly nurtured, a single psychedelic experience could provide relief from anxiety and depression, addictions and compulsions, and lead to a range of positive outcomes including rediscovery of a sense of meaning, increases in wellbeing, pro-social behaviour, a renewed sense of optimism, and a newfound connectedness to the self, to others, and to nature, which frequently last several months or more.    

Psychedelic experience seems to temporarily crack open a kind of new critical window; a window of opportunity with great neuroplastic potential,  with an enriched interpretation of the world in terms of personal relevance, amplified analogical thinking, and a wider web of semantic association; one that not only reveals the elemental foundations of thought and perception to the conscious mind, but invites it to participate, to orient toward personal significance, to draw together disparate elements of lived experience, and produce insightful experiences  and emotional breakthroughs that can mark the beginning of a process of re-orienting priorities, attention, attitudes, and behaviour.   

Could this process altogether represent a change in the mobilization, distribution, and utilization of limited energetic resources by the serotonin system? An opportunity for the master homeostatic regulator to integrate all the various pertinent variables, and to re-orient and re-align the mind, body, and outside world? 

Or is pychedelic experience more like bumping the lamp on the serotonin system, momentarily illuminating otherwise hidden foundations of sensation, memory, and imagination, giving us myriad new perspectives on our goals, values, past experiences and and potential, and prompting a transformative realignment of mind, body and world? 

Whatever variation the answer may come in, there is no doubt for those who have undergone it and those who have studied it alike that psychedelic experience involves, like serotonin and auxin, almost all aspects of our lives.
